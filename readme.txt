This code (mainly the mirror.js) mirrors the text input of valid CSS into exactly the same css mirrored. The way to use it in your project, if RTL interfaces are needed, you should switch reference to css from your LTR css to your RTL. In other words; this isn`t for "overwrite rules" kind of development, it is for "replace css."

index.htm is an example page that takes css input as text, and produces another mirrored version.

TODO:
- Style the test page!
- Add minifier
- Write a better README file!
- Test for more scenarios
