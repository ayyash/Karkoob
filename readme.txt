These files do two things:

- Compile a LESS CSS file into one css, and outputs the generated css text
- Genrates an RTL version by overwriting single properties with mirrored version

TODO:
- Style the test page!
- Allow multiple css files (besides the one generated by LESS inline)
- Add minifier
- Write a better README file!
- Remove absolute file references
- Test for more scenarios
